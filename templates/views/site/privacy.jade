				| Hacksmiths will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.
			p
				| We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you’ll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won’t do anything evil with it.
			p We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.
			p
				| That’s the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

			p
				| Like most website operators, Hacksmiths collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Hacksmiths’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Hacksmiths’ visitors use its website. From time to time, Hacksmiths may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
			p
				| Hacksmiths also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Hacksmiths does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

				a#Gathering_of_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_31
				| Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
			p
				| Certain visitors to Hacksmiths’s websites choose to interact with Hacksmiths in ways that require Hacksmiths to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Hacksmiths gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Hacksmiths collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Hacksmiths. Hacksmiths does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.
			p
				| Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user’s name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

				a#Protection_of_Certain_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_41
				| Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
			p
				| Hacksmiths discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Hacksmiths’ behalf or to provide services available at Hacksmiths’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Hacksmiths will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Hacksmiths discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Hacksmiths believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Hacksmiths, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Hacksmiths may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Hacksmiths and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Hacksmiths takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Hacksmiths visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Hacksmiths’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of Hacksmiths’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
