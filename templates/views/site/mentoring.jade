				p We also ask that you have taken part in one of our projects.
				ul
					li you should be available during some form of regular schedule to meet on slack or Google Hangouts with your mentee.
					li you should have experience working on one or more Hacksmiths software projects.
					li you don't need to be an expert in the field in order to be a mentor.  The biggest requirement is a desire to help others learn!
